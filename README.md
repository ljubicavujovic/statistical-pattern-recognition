# Statistical pattern recognition  

## Introduction  
This is the set of problems solved during one semestar class Statistical Pattern 
Recognition at Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Sistems and Signals Department. 
This course's goal was to introduce machine learning algorithms, both through 
understanding of theory and practical exercises. Every practical exercise is 
implementation of some machine learning algorithm followed by written report. 
## List of implemented algorithms
* Linear Regression 
* Logistic Regression 
* Generative Models 
* SVM 

In the folder data are simple and small datasets which can be used for visualization
of classification line and other meaningful metrics. If you want to run 
logistic regression example, simply run: 

`python logistic_regression.py`

## Reports 
In the folder reports are explanation of theory behind every algorithm. These are 
available only on Serbian.
